- Python script enabling downloaded files to be sorted and saved in designated folders across the entire computer's directory.
- When the downloaded file is saved, the script assesses the file type by the ending of the file name. It is then transferred to an appropriate le type folder (audio, video, photo) marked by the user.
- The Python script is run at launch through a paired bash script that is enabled in the system.
